This project automates the process of detecting and isolating compromised EC2 instances in real-time, minimizing security risks. It is designed for AWS users of all levels, including beginners, and includes step-by-step instructions to deploy the required resources and configurations. The workflow uses EC2, GuardDuty, S3, EventBridge, and Lambda to detect, mitigate, and notify about security threats while adhering to the **principle of least privilege** for IAM roles and policies.
